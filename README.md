Our team BigO4 has come up with a cloud based service by using both hardware as well as software . So our basic motive is to create a cloud based service for our mobile phones which thereby will reduce the cost of making the phone since while making a phone of higher storage takes in use of it more amount of semiconductor which is also a radioactive element and causes harmful radiation. It is also a limited resource and we are leading towards the shortage of this resource because of the abundant use of it . According to a report by Allied Market Research, the global semiconductor market was valued at $513 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach $1,213 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 9.4% from 2021 to 2030.These statistics highlight the significant impact of e-waste and semiconductors on the environment and the need for more sustainable practices in the mobile industry. 
So, we are focusing on a cloud phone which will not only reduce the cost of phone but also it will save our resources and increase the flexibility of the usage of our device. Since we are building a phone of less storage and doing most of our things on cloud server it will lead to the better performance of phone and in term will increase the battery life of phone an also it will lead to a seamless usage of devices.
By shifting everything on cloud we can easily access our documents whenever and wherever required. Now taking in count the security measures we are also adding two factor authentication in order to secure the data that we have in our cloud.
